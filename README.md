# Many To Many

```
In the Many-to-Many threading model, there is a pool of
user-level threads that can be mapped onto a pool of
kernel-level threads. The runtime system is responsible for
managing the mapping and scheduling of threads. This
model allows for more flexibility and efficiency, especially in
scenarios where a large number of threads may not
necessarily benefit from a one-to-one mapping with kernel
threads.

```

# Many To One

```
The "Many-to-One" threading model involves mapping
many user-level threads to a single kernel-level (or
system-level) thread. It's often associated with user-level
threading libraries where the kernel is unaware of the
existence of individual user-level threads.

# Many to Many Model

```
Consider an online multiplayer game server that needs to handle a large number of
concurrent players. Each player's interactions, such as movement and actions, need to
be processed independently to provide real-time responsiveness. The Many-to-Many
threading model could be a suitable choice for implementing the server, allowing a pool
of user-level threads to handle player interactions and mapping them onto a pool of
kernel-level threads.
